# Facebook stores almost every site you go to
The Facebook 'Like' button appears on almost all major sites these days and everytime the button is loaded that information is stored by Facebook. Facebook uses this information to target advertising to you and your friends. Site owner's want the button because it can generate a lot of traffic.

This project is a quick attempt (about 30 minutes) to suggest a way for site developers to have their cake and eat it too.


*this snippet places an image in the location of the facebook like button, and defers the loading of Facebook's scripts until clicked*

The trade-off is that the user must click twice.
